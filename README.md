# exploratory-factor-analysis
an example of a Python function that performs an exploratory factor analysis

```
import numpy as np
from sklearn.decomposition import FactorAnalysis

def perform_exploratory_factor_analysis(data, num_factors):
    # Create the FactorAnalysis object
    factor_analyzer = FactorAnalysis(n_components=num_factors)

    # Fit the data using the factor analyzer
    factor_analyzer.fit(data)

    # Get the loadings matrix
    loadings_matrix = factor_analyzer.components_

    # Return the loadings matrix
    return loadings_matrix
```

In this function, we first import the necessary modules. Then, we define the function `perform_exploratory_factor_analysis`, which takes in two arguments: the data to be analyzed, and the number of factors to be extracted.

Next, we create a `FactorAnalysis` object and fit the data to it. This performs the actual factor analysis and extracts the desired number of factors from the data.

Finally, we retrieve the loadings matrix from the factor analyzer and return it. The loadings matrix contains the weights of each variable on each factor, which can be used to interpret the factors and understand the underlying structure of the data.
